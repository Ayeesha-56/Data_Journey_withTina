I wasn’t able to complete today’s exact dataset task.

But I’ve previously worked on something very similar, merging datasets in Excel using:

• VLOOKUP
• Core Excel functions
• Data cleaning techniques

So I’m sharing that as a reference point.
One thing I’ve realized:
Growth isn’t always about doing something brand new.
Sometimes it’s recognizing that you’ve already built the foundation.
Tomorrow, we execute fully.
