Today, I wrapped up my guided video project, and this one was different.

Whenever I follow a guided project, I don’t just watch to replicate the dashboard. I study the thinking pattern behind it:
	•	What’s the first thing the mentor does when they see the dataset?
	•	How do they approach the business problem?
	•	How do they structure their model before building visuals?

This time, I learned so much.

From building a solid data model…
To implementing time intelligence functions…
To writing DAX in ways that made me pause and think, “How did they even think to this level?”

It was powerful.

I paid close attention to:
	•	How each chart was structured to answer a specific insight
	•	The intentional use of colors
	•	Clean wireframing and layout decisions
	•	How storytelling guided the entire dashboard

It wasn’t just a tutorial. It was a masterclass in analytical thinking.

I’m truly inspired, and I’ll be applying these principles to all my Excel and dashboard projects moving forward.

Thank you so much, Daniel Nte
Thank you so much, Rita.
