Day 9-10/120: Guided Project with Daniel Nte.
What I’m really learning isn’t just formulas… it’s pattern.
Watching how he structures his worksheets, builds models, and thinks through problems is eye-opening. Seeing how he used his DAX method in Excel changed my perspective completely.
The calendar table. The time intelligence. The simplicity.

It’s not about rushing videos. it’s about slowing down and understanding the architecture behind the work.
