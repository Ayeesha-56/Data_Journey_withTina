Day 12/120 — Building With Data 📊

Today, I diverted from my guided project to complete a bootcamp project (CDI).
Interestingly, it was similar to what I’ve been working on ,a sales performance analysis but this time, I focused deeper on business impact.

I analyzed a sales dashboard to answer:

• Where is revenue really coming from?
• Which segments drive profit?
• What products deserve more strategic focus?
• Is growth consistent month-to-month?
Beyond building the dashboard, I identified actionable recommendations on what the business owner should do differently to improve performance.
From raw data → insights → decision-making.
