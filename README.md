Day 5of 120datadayswithRita.
Today is to pick a niche and state five business problems. i am exploring how data can solve real investment problems, turning confusion into actionable insights as a data analyst.

Here are 5 key challenges investors face and how I can help:
1️⃣ Where Should I Invest for Maximum Return?
Many investors follow hype or social media noise instead of analyzing facts.
As a data analyst, I would:
	•	Collect historical prices, ROI trends, volatility, inflation, and risk-adjusted returns
	•	Build a dashboard comparing Nigerian stocks vs US stocks, equities vs bonds, and real estate
	•	Help investors identify which asset class performs best over 5 years

Portfolio Risk Management
Investors often don’t understand their exposure to market swings.
As a data analyst, I would:
	•	Analyze asset correlation, volatility, drawdowns, and beta
	•	Create a portfolio risk analyzer showing worst-case scenarios and diversification benefits
	•	Help preserve wealth through informed risk decisions
Market Timing vs Long-Term Holding
Many beginners panic in market dips or trade too frequently.
As a data analyst, I would:
	•	Examine historical market cycles and bull/bear trends
	•	Simulate monthly investments vs lump sum and short-term trading strategies
	•	Provide data-backed insights to reduce emotional investing

4️⃣ Identifying Undervalued Stocks
Investors struggle to tell if a stock is overpriced or undervalued.
As a data analyst, I would:
	•	Collect P/E ratios, earnings growth, revenue trends, and dividend yields
	•	Build a stock valuation comparison model
	•	Highlight investment opportunities based on data, not guesswork

5️⃣ Inflation Impact on Wealth
People often think their wealth is growing but inflation can eat returns.
As a data analyst, I would:
	•	Track inflation vs asset growth
	•	Build a “Real Wealth Growth” calculator comparing savings, equities, and other investments
	•	Show if investments actually outperform inflation

💡 Takeaway: Investing isn’t guessing. It’s structured decision-making powered by data.
