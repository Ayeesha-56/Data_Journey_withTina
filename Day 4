Day 4 of 120 Days of Data — Tool Strength Reflection

Today was about reflecting on my strengths across the tools I use as a data analyst: Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Python (a little R-ish too).

Here’s my honest rating:

Excel – Between Intermediate and Advanced
Excel is one of my strongest tools. I understand the interface, core functions, and business interpretation very well.
However, I still have gaps especially in advanced areas like macros and VBA. I know there’s more depth I haven’t fully explored yet, and I’m intentional about filling those holes.

SQL – Solid Intermediate (Almost Advanced)
SQL is actually my best tool technically.
I’m confident answering business questions with it.

But I won’t call myself advanced yet because:
	•	I sometimes struggle with complex query interpretation
	•	Nested queries, CTEs, and advanced subqueries can slow me down
	•	I’m still deepening my mastery of window functions (RANK, LEAD, etc.)

I know the foundation is strong now it’s about refinement.

Power BI – Intermediate
Not in-between. Just intermediate.
I understand the fundamentals. My growth area is more around building cleaner, more strategic dashboards, less about knowing features, more about structuring insights.

Python – Beginner
I understand the basics:
	•	Loading data
	•	Inspecting datasets
	•	Checking top/bottom records
	•	Basic data exploration

But I’m still early in my journey here.

What I love most about today is this:
I now clearly know where my strengths lie and where I need depth.

And that clarity?
That’s growth.

Cheers to getting better, intentionally 🥂
