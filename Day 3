Day 3 of my 120datadayswithTina
The project I reviewed was the HR dashboard that I built a month ago. And seeing that dashboard, I asked myself, what was the first thing I did? Did I even pass through the data analysis stages of asking questions and defining my objectives? Or did I just build a dashboard for building sake?

But right now, I can say there is growth. Because if I want to build a dashboard now, I try to find the objective first. I look at how useful the dashboard will be. I go for clarity now. And that is growth, which I’m grateful for.

So cheers to building dashboards that are useful. Cheers to building dashboards that have clarity. Cheers to building dashboards that solve business problems.
